        <h2 id="anchor">What makes a superhero?</h2>
            <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal 
                person couldn't. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than 
                any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish 
                good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. 
                <br>For instance, a 
                good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or 
                human-interest story. But if it's a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it 
                becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn't 
                do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

            <p>
                After frequent attacks by Oracle, Pasha took everything into his own hands and dealt with him, 
                spending his strength and skills on him. All campus students are insanely grateful to him for what 
                he does for this small town of Innovation Campus.
